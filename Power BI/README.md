## Problem Statement

Atliq is a company that sells hardware like PC, mouse, printers and so on to different customers â€“ Croma, BestBuy, Staples, Flipkart, Amazon. These stores will then sell the hardware to consumers like you and me.  

Atliq Hardware has become one of the fastest growing company in the electronic Goods Market. While they grew substantially in last few years, they had some bad experience  in Latin America. Their goal was to establish a presence there. Despite opening their own store, they suffered a huge loss.. And this happened because they made all this decisions just based on some surveys that they conducted and just based on their intuitions.   

In the annual strategic meeting one of the top items was to onboard data analytics in the company and to make data-driven decisions. So the company has hired a data analytics team and they have assigned the task to that team to onboard data analytics and to bring a lot of transparency into their data so that they can make accurate decisions.
